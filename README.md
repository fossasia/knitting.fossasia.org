### knitting.fossasia.org [![View on Github][github-logo]][knitting.fossasia.org-repo]

This is this overview site over the different knitting projects and aims at introducing new people to the community.
You can visit the [website][this-site] and [add new entries][knitting.fossasia.org-edit]
for [projects][project-list] and [related work][related-work].

### circle-knitting [![View on Github][github-logo]][circle-knitting-repo]

There are commercial circular knitting machines, that are nearly completely made from plastic. 
A popular modul is the Addi Express. 
Plastic can be easily printed out on 3D printers. 
This project implements the idea to code a circular knitting machine. 
As inexpensive small PCs components like the Rapsberry PI and Arduinos become increasingly powerful there is even an option to include them as optional components in such a 3D printed knitting machine.

### knitweb [![View on Github][github-logo]][knitweb-repo]

[`knitweb`][knitweb-repo] is an app frontend and backend that works together with the
[`knitlib`][knitserver] server and uses the [`knitpat`][knitpat] format.

[![Issues Ready to Work on][knitweb-waffle-badge]][knitweb-waffle]



### knitlib [![View on Github][github-logo]][knitlib-repo]

Knitlib is a library designed to support the operation of varied knitting machines, mechanisms, and hacks.
Knitlib is based on projects like [AYAB][ayab], PDD, and KnitterStream to control knitting machines.
Knitlib features a plugin system for knitting machines and implements an API to control machines' operation,
knitting jobs and knitting patterns. The software is based on Python.
There also is a Web API.
Among the primary tasks is to develop plugins based on this solution to add support for more machines.

### knitserver [![View on Github][github-logo]][knitserver-repo]

Knitserver is a [Knitlib][knitlib] client that provides REST API endpoints for knitting machine software and control.
Knitserver is designed to interact with [Knitweb][knitweb].

How to Contribute
-----------------

You can have various reasons to contribute to the software.
This section aims to give you an overview over ways to get started.

If you have any questions or like to [get in touch][get-in-touch].

### Translate

A majority of people on earth do not speak English.
By translating software, you make it accessible to thousands of people.

You can add translations to these projects:

- [kniteditor][kniteditor]
  - [Blogpost about localization implementation](http://blog.fossasia.org/awesome-kivy-revelations/)
  - [A video on how to translate][kniteditor-translate-video]
- [knitweb][knitweb]
  - [Blogpost about localization](http://blog.fossasia.org/knitweb-localization/)



### Improve Metrics

Improving code metrics requires coding but not the understanding of how the code works.
You learn how to set up this specific environment, fix some code and while doing this,
you read it and get familiar with it.
When your pull request is merged, you have contributed to the health of the project.

Some of the repositories have code metrics like code coverage and code quality.
They can be improved easily.
E.g. in [this example][improve-metrics-example] you can find this error:

     	        bbox = list(map(lambda f: f*zoom, layout.bounding_box))
	    missing whitespace around arithmetic operator

This can fix this by adding spaces around the operator. 



### Solve Issues

All the projects have "issues" attached to them.
They show bugs and feature requests.
A solved issue improves the life of somebody on earth.
When solving the issue, you are introduced to the development process of the project and learn how to adapt the project to your needs.

Issues can be found in the issue tracker of github.
You can find them through the "Repository" links of the [projects][project-list] or by clicking these badges:  
[![knitting.fossasia.org-waffle-badge]][knitting.fossasia.org-waffle]  
The badge above links to the overview of all listed projects.
If you find an issue which interests you, please comment that you would like to work on it.
This way, you get help and it is not done twice.

Issues can be `easy`. You may pick those first to get into the project. 
Issues can have multiple bullet points or check boxes.
You do not need to solve all of them.
You can choose one and solve it.

The projects have tests and documentation:  
[![Test Coverage][knittingpattern-test-coverage-badge]][knittingpattern-test-coverage]
[![Read the Documentation][knittingpattern-rtd-badge]][knittingpattern-rtd]  
Code should be documented and tested.
Consider trying out [documentation driven development][ddd],
[Test-First][test-first] and [test-driven development][tdd].



### Get in Touch

[FOSSASIA][fossasia] has a [Slack][slack] to chat in the community.
There is a [mailing list for knitting applications][mailing-list] such as [these listed][project-list]. You can alse join the [FOSSASIA mailing list][fossasia-mailing-list].
You can comment on issues and through these reach the developers directly.
We have a Gitter chat which you can join: [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/fashiontec/knitapps](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/fashiontec/knitapps?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
